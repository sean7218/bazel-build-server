# Bazel Build Server

Bazel implemention for [build server protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/) and mainly working with [sourcekit-lsp](https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp).

## Requirements

- Xcode 16.3 
- Swift toolchain 6.1.0
- Enable global_index_store in .bazelrc

## Getting Started

1. Creating a buildServer.json at the root of your project shown below. 
    - The `argv` need to point at the buildserver executable
    - The `target` will be used by `aquery` to get all the compiler arguments and targets. 
    - The `sdk` is what will be replaced for `__BAZEL_XCODE_SDKROOT__`
    - The `indexStorePath` is the location where all indexstore files are.
    - The `indexDatabasePath` is the location for index.db output

```json
{
  "name": "example-app",
  "argv": [
    "/Users/sean7218/bazel/buildserver/target/debug/buildserver"
  ],
  "version": "1.0.0",  
  "bspVersion": "2.0.0",
  "languages": ["swift"],
  "target": "//App:App",
  "sdk": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator18.4.sdk",
  "indexStorePath": "/Users/sean7218/bazel/buildserver/example-app/bazel-out/_global_index_store",
  "indexDatabasePath": "/Users/sean7218/bazel/buildserver/example-app/.index-db"
}
```

2. Compile the build server by running `cargo build`, and the executable will be in `bazel-build-server/target/debug/buildserver`, 
and change the `argv` in the buildServer.json file as well. 

```bash
cargo build
```

3. Before compile your project with bazel, you need to set the global index in `.bazelrc` file, then compile your project based on the target specified in the `buildServer.json` such as `bazel build //App:App`

```bash
# either this
build --features swift.use_global_index_store
build --features swift.index_while_building
# or 
build --features swift.use_global_index_store
build --swiftcopt=-index-store-path
build --swiftcopt=$(OUTPUT_BASE)/indexstore
```

4. Open your project in vscode or neovim, you should be see logs both in sourcekit-lsp and bsp.log

5. Once the server is started Logging is stored in `~/.sourcekit-bsp/bsp.log`, it is recommended to open it and see any issues.

## Debugging

todo!
